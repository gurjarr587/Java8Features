Basic Syntax :
(argument-list) -> {function-body}
Where: Argument-list: It can be empty or non-empty as well.
Arrow notation/lambda notation: It is used to link arguments-list and body of expression.
Function-body: It contains expressions and statements for lambda expression.

Defination : Lambda expression is used to provide the implementation of functional interface. A Functional Interface is
an interface with only single abstract method. In case of lambda expression,we donâ€™t need to define the method again
for providing the implementation so it saves lots of coding efforts.
